I've been meaning to write this story for a long time.

While putting off writing this story, I've shared it in person over beers many a time. Those people probably didn't believe me, so to establish some credibility out of the gate, here's an ominous picture of me walking along a girder 16 stories underground:

Let's rewind.

It's 2013 and I've quit my job as an Account Manager in San Francisco and moved back to Erie, Colorado to figure myself via an expensive self-help program called grad school. One day, during the restless boredom leading up to beginnging school I decided to click on one of a third party ad you often see at the bottom of outstanding online publications, not naming names.

 <div><img class="project-image" alt="Skoop homepage" src="/images/titan/forbes.jpg"></div>

 Just kidding, I am naming names. This is Forbes.

 The ad featured an image of what some people affectionatly call #abandonedporn - essentailly a trap to pull you into some sort of listicle that features images of eery empty places arranged (assumingly) in order of most to least likely to kill you from exposure to deadly toxins.

 It just so happened that in this list there was one image that caught my attention - a picture of missle silo. Although I don;t have the image on hand, I remember it being a shot taken from the top of a silo angled downward with the bottom of silo dissappearing into darkness. The only description of the photo read "Photo of silo in Titan missile complex."

 Because I'm a nerd for this type of stuff, I started researching these missle complexes...

 As we're rolling along the road, Tom points out the shoulders on each side of the road. They stick out about 5 feet on each side of the street and appear to be meticulously leveled. These shoulders, he explains, are built for tank access to base. It allows tanks to roll down the street without crushing the ashphault.

 After another 20 or so minutes passing dilapidated wood chacks and farm equipment, we turn down a small dirt road that, should the directions I've routed on my phone be correct, will lead us to the complex. About 5 minutes later, on the horizon, we we see the tilted metal poles that I'd seen in pictures online. We'd found the entrance.
