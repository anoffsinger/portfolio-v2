                    <p><p>BDW frequently holds what they call “Design Sprints.” During these sprints, a client comes to the school and poses a business problem to the students. In teams of 3, we then have a day and a half to solve the problem and pitch our concepts and prototypes. This project was one such occasion.</p> <p>For this sprint, our client was Starwood Preferred Guests (SPG) - the premiere rewards program that owns luxury hotels such as the W, the St. Regis, the Sheraton, and more. The brief was simple - not enough people were using the SPG app, which is essentially a booking utility. Our goal was to get people using the app and to generate buzz around the app in general.<p> Based on user research, we learned that SPG members were very passionate about their points, but weren't always sure how much they were actually worth. At the same time, they wanted an app that would help them explore new ways to spend their points rather than just a booking utility similar to the desktop experience.</p> <p>Based on this knowledge, I designed an app that would allow them to set and track goals and share their progress with friends in a gamified way.</p></p>
