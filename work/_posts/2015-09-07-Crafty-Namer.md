Who doesn’t like craft beer?

That was our thinking behind The Crafty Namer, which was developed as an entry in a week-long competition to design, build, and market a webpage - with the ultimate goal of garnering the most page views.

With the click of a button, The Crafty Namer serves up a random (and potentially hilarious) name for your next batch of home-brew. Although the webpage didn’t end up taking first in the competition, it did garner attention from well-known craft beer brands like Odell Brewing and the Boulder Beer Company. With generated names like “Heisenberg’s Hefeweissen” and “Freudian Sip,” how could it not?

I was the sole designer on this project, and wrote all HTML and CSS.
