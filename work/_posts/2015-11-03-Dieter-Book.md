description: I designed this simple book featuring the infamous designer's "10 Principles For Good Design" while at BDW.<p>I used a simple grid system based on the dimensions of the Braun T3 Pocket Radio - the product known for influencing the design of Apple’s iPod. The products showcased in the book span Dieter’s work for both Braun and Vitsoe.
