description: This app concept was conceived during a design sprint with Starwood Preferred Guests. <p>User research revealed that SPG members are passionate about their travel points, but aren't sure of their monetary value. At the same time, members wanted an app that would help them explore new ways to spend their points rather than just a booking utility.<p>Based on this knowledge, I designed an app that would allow them to set and track transparent point goals in a gamified way.
