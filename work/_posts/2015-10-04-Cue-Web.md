<div><img class="project-image" alt="Cue homepage" src="http://localhost:4000/images/cue-splashpage-full.png"></div>

In addition to designing the Cue mobile app - an app that helps you meet new people in your immediate vicinity - I also designed the company’s fully responsive splashpage.

The goal of the site in its first (and current) phase is simple: collect email addresses from visitors interested in the app. For that reason, the primary directive of the page is to submit an email address. The page is also meant to demo the app and explain the company’s philosophy - both of which are achieved in later panels.

I wrote all HTML, CSS, and Javascript for this project.

<div class="project-image-small-container">
	<img src="http://localhost:4000/images/cue-splashpage-mobile.gif" class="project-image-half-left"></img>
	<img src="http://localhost:4000/images/cue-logo-animation.gif" class="project-image-half-right"></img>
</div>
