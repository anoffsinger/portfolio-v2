description: This app concept came out of a design sprint for Starwood Preferred Guests. <p>User research showed that SPG members were passionate about their travel points, but didn't understand their monetary value. At the same time, members wanted an app that would help them explore new ways to spend their points rather than just another booking utility.<p>To solve these problems, I designed an app that would allow them to set and track transparent point goals with a touch of gamification.
