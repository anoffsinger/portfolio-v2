description: A few friends and I founded Cue while at BDW. It's a social app that introduces you to people in your immediate vicinity based on matching customizable tags through BLE. The design is deliberately open-ended to allow the app to be used for many purposes - most obviously in a social sense.<p>Although Cue never ultimately launched, we built and tested awesome prototypes and garnered <a href="http://digiday.com/brands/five-recent-digital-student-projects-know/" target="_blank">coverage</a> along the way.
