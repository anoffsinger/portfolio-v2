description: Whether from being in a new place or just craving more social interaction, there are times when we all feel like meeting new people. Thatâ€™s why I cofounded Cue, a social app that uses Bluetooth Low Energy to introduce you to people within 150ft of your location that share your interests.<p>Although Cue never ultimately launched, we garnered some <a href="http://digiday.com/brands/five-recent-digital-student-projects-know/" target="_blank">coverage</a> and took second place in CU's Mobile New Venture Challenge.
