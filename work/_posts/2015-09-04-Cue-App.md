Whether from being in a new place, or simply feeling as though you’re not being social enough, there are times when all of us feel like we need to meet new people. That’s why I cofounded Cue, a new kind of social app that introduces you to people within 150 feet of your location that share your interests.

During the 5-month period in which Cue was conceived, designed, and developed I served (and continue to serve) as Chief Design Officer for the company. In addition to branding Cue, I created mobile wireframes and prototypes, carried out user testing, and then went on to design Cue’s UI and animation.

In designing Cue, a few core objectives drove my design decisions: the app needed to feel fun and exciting, be simple to use, and ensure that people using the app actually met up. Using bright colors, a minimal but lively UI, and a one-of-a-kind, simple to use proximity interface were a few of the tactics I used to achieve my objectives.

In April 2014, Cue took second place in CU Boulder’s Mobile New Venture Challenge and was also awarded office space at Galvanize Boulder, where the company will continue to grow in coming months. In July of 2014, the app was featured in an article by Digiday about student-made products that are making waves.

Version 1 of Cue will launch in the iOS App Store in Fall of 2014.
