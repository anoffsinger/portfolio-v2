description: While at <a href="https://getfinal.com/">Final</a>, I worked alongside a small team of five going through Techstars. I designed the first iterations of their mobile and web apps, both of which are aimed at combating fraud while providing intelligent and transparent spending tools. <p>Near the conclusion of Techstars, I left Final to join Uber. Final has since entered Y-Combinator and is now in <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2015/01/27/yc-backed-final-raises-a-million-for-its-fraud-fighting-credit-card/" target="_blank">private beta</a>.
