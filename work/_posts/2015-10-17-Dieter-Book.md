thumbnailDesc: Shot from the Cue App
description: Whether from being in a new place, or simply feeling as though you’re not being social enough, there are times when all of us feel like we need to meet new people. That’s why I cofounded Cue, a new kind of social app that introduces you to people within 150 feet of your location that share your interests.
