description: While working with the <a href="http://humandesign.agency/">Human Design</a> team we created a new website and seller portal for a health shake called Skoop. The Boulder-based company, founded by Alex Bogusky, makes a shake mix sold by individual resellers around the nation.<p>After working with the design team on the site, I then joined the front-end development team to build it.
