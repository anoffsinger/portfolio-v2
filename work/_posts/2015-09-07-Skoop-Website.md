While at Human Design, I worked on creating a new website and seller portal for an organic health supplement called Skoop. The Boulder-based company, which was founded by Alex Bogusky, makes a nutrient-rich drink mix sold by individual resellers around the nation.

I joined the project shortly after design had begun, working alongside 2 other designers. After designing the site, I then joined the front-end development team and coded it. Lorem text is used in some of the comps below due to the WIP nature of this project.

Skoopâ€™s new site launched August 15, 2014.
